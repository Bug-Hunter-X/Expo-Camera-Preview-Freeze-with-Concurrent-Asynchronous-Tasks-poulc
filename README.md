# Expo Camera Preview Freeze

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera preview freezes when concurrent asynchronous operations are performed. The main thread blockage is suspected to be the root cause.

## Bug Description

The Expo Camera preview intermittently freezes when performing long-running asynchronous tasks, such as network requests or complex computations. This makes the application unresponsive and unreliable.

## Reproduction

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app (using Expo Go or a similar method).
3. Observe the camera preview. 
4. Initiate a long-running asynchronous task (simulated in the example code).
5. The camera preview is likely to freeze or stop updating during the long-running task.

## Solution

The solution involves using techniques to prevent blocking the main thread. This can be achieved through the following:

* **Asynchronous operations in separate threads:**  Utilize technologies like React Native's background threads or promises to perform the tasks in parallel without blocking the main thread, preventing the blocking of camera preview rendering.
* **Optimizing asynchronous tasks:** Reduce the execution time of the asynchronous task.
* **Using separate threads with worker:** Use web workers in the browser context or background tasks in the React Native context to move the asynchronous task to a separate thread.
