This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API in conjunction with other asynchronous operations.  The camera preview might freeze or stop updating if another asynchronous task, such as a network request, takes a significant amount of time to complete. This is likely due to the main thread being blocked, preventing the camera preview from updating properly.  The issue is intermittent and hard to reproduce reliably.
